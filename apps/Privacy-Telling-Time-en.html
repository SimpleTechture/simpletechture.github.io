<h4 class="mute">Last revised on Oktober 1, 2015</h4>
<hr>
<p>Telling Time knows you care how information about you is used and shared. We hope the following statements will help you understand how Telling Time will collect, use and protect the information you provide to us on our site or app. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<h4>What we collect and how we use it</h4>
<h5>Information you provide</h5>
<p>When you sign up for a Telling Time account, or another Telling Time service or promotion that requires registration, we ask you for personal information (such as your name, email address and an account password). We may combine the information you submit under your account, with information from other Telling Time services or third parties to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our services. For certain services, we may allow you to opt out of combining such information.</p>
<h5>Unique Device ID</h5>
<p>When you use the Telling Time Windows 10, Windows 8(.1) or Windowns Phone Applications, we may collect your Unique Device ID ('UDID') and/or IP address. We use your UDID to provide a tailored experience for you. The UDID information is collected in order to determine the aggregate number of unique devices using our service or parts of our service, to track total usage, analyze data, and communicate with you more effectively. We may combine your UDID with information from third parties to provide you with a better experience and to improve the quality of our service. We do not share any personally identifiable information with third parties in association with your UDID.</p>
<h5>Third party sites</h5>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies only to sites and apps that are owned and operated by Telling Time. Telling Time cannot regulate other sites linked from within our various web sites and services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on your computer, collect data or solicit personal information from you. You should familiarize yourself with their unique Privacy Policies, should you choose to visit their sites.</p>
<h4>How do we use your information?</h4>
<p>When you sign up for a particular service that requires registration, we ask you to provide personal information. If Telling Time would like to use this information in a manner different than the purpose for which it was collected, then we will ask for your consent prior to such use. We will not collect or use sensitive information for purposes other than those described in this Privacy Policy and/or in the specific service notices, unless we have obtained your prior consent. You may decline to submit personal information to any of our services, in which case Telling Time may not be able to provide those services to you.</p>
<h4>How do we share your information?</h4>
<p>Telling Time does not share your personal information with other institutions outside of Telling Time. However, Telling Time may share your personal information only if we have a good faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is reasonably necessary to (a) satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or enforceable governmental request, (b) enforce applicable Terms Of Use, including investigation of potential violations thereof, (c) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues, or (d) protect against imminent harm to the rights, property or safety of Telling Time, its users or the public as required or permitted by law.</p>
<h4>Information Security</h4>
<p>Telling Time takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. These include internal reviews of our data collection, storage and processing practices and security measures, as well as physical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to systems where we store personal data. We restrict access to personal information to Telling Time employees, contractors and agents who need to know that information to operate, develop or improve our services. These individuals are bound by confidentiality obligations and may be subject to discipline, including termination and criminal prosecution, if they fail to meet these obligations.</p>
<h4>Data Integrity</h4>
<p>Telling Time processes personal information only for the purposes for which it was collected and in accordance with this Privacy Policy or any applicable service-specific privacy notice. We review our data collection, storage and processing practices to ensure that we only collect, store and process the personal information needed to provide or improve our services. We take reasonable steps to ensure that the personal information we process is accurate, complete, and current, but we depend on our users to update or correct their personal information whenever necessary.</p>
<h4>Accessing and updating personal information</h4>
<p>When you use any Telling Time service, we make good faith efforts to provide you with access to your personal information and either to correct this data if it is inaccurate or to delete such data at your request if it is not otherwise required to be retained by law or for legitimate service purposes. We ask individual users to identify themselves and the information requested to be accessed, corrected or removed before processing such requests, and we may decline to process requests that are unreasonably repetitive or systematic, require disproportionate technical effort, jeopardize the privacy of others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests concerning information residing on backup tapes), or for which access is not otherwise required. In any case where we provide information access and correction, we perform this service free of charge, except if doing so would require a disproportionate effort. Some of our services have different procedures to access, correct or delete users' personal information.</p>
<h4>Enforcement</h4>
<p>Telling Time periodically reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. When we receive formal written complaints regarding privacy issues, it is our policy to contact the complaining user regarding his or her concerns. We will cooperate with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including local data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that cannot be resolved between Telling Time and an individual.</p>
